Project Title: Lyric Buzz

Description: Lyric Buzz is a website dedicated to providing lyrics for Christian hymns. Users can search, view, like, comment on, and add lyrics. Admins can approve lyrics and comments to ensure content quality.

### Introduction
Lyric Buzz is a dedicated platform for discovering and sharing the timeless beauty of Christian hymns. In a world where music often transcends the spoken word, hymns hold a special place, offering spiritual solace, communal connection, and profound reflection. Lyric Buzz aims to be the go-to resource for hymn enthusiasts, churchgoers, choir members, and anyone who finds inspiration in the lyrics of these spiritual songs.

Our platform not only provides a comprehensive collection of Christian hymn lyrics but also fosters a community where users can engage with the hymns they love. Whether you're searching for the lyrics of a specific hymn, exploring new ones, or contributing by adding your favorites, Lyric Buzz offers a seamless and enriching experience.

### Project Overview
Lyric Buzz is built using the robust Django framework, ensuring a secure, scalable, and efficient platform. The website features user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Once logged in, users can like, comment on, and add new hymn lyrics, subject to admin approval to maintain content quality.

### Key features of Lyric Buzz include:

**User Authentication:** Secure registration and login processes enable users to interact with the siteâ€™s features fully.

**Lyric Management:** Users can browse approved lyrics, add new ones, like their favorites, and engage with the community through comments.

**Admin Panel:** Administrators have the power to approve or reject lyrics and comments, ensuring the content remains appropriate and high-quality.

**Search Functionality:** An intuitive search bar allows users to find hymns quickly by title or lyrics.

**Responsive Design:** The site is designed to be accessible and user-friendly across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

### Goals

The primary goal of Lyric Buzz is to create a welcoming and user-friendly environment where individuals can immerse themselves in the lyrical richness of Christian hymns. By providing easy access to these lyrics, we hope to enhance both personal devotion and communal worship experiences.

### Agile Methodology

GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects served as our primary Agile tool for managing this project. 
We used GitHub Projects to plan, track, and manage user stories, issues, and tasks time to time via a basic Kanban board.

To prioritize tasks efficiently within the available time, we employed the MoSCoW method, supplemented by custom GitHub project labels.

<img src="documentation/testing/screenshot-kanban.jpg" width="800">


GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues was another crucial tool in our Agile process. Using a custom User Story Template, we managed and tracked user stories effectively.

Open Issues

Closed Issues

MoSCoW Prioritization
We decomposed our Epics into smaller stories before prioritizing and implementing them. This approach allowed us to apply MoSCoW prioritization and labels to our user stories within the Issues tab.

- Must Have: Tasks that are guaranteed to be delivered (maximum 60% of stories)
- Should Have: Tasks that add significant value but are not vital (approximately 20% of stories)
- Could Have: Tasks with a small impact if left out (20% of stories)
- Won't Have: Tasks that are not a priority for this iteration
This prioritization ensured that we focused on delivering the most critical features first while also planning for additional value-added tasks as time allowed.

## Testing
All testing results can be found here [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database On ElephantSQL
- Log into the [PostgreSQL from Code Institute
](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) website and enter your email and **click submit**
- As soon as you sign up you will recieve a email with all the details about your PostgreSQL database.
- You will find the postgres url, copy that.
- Head over to gitpod and create a **Database URL** environment variable in your env.py file and set it equal to the copied URL.

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!
